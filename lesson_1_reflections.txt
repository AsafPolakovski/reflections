How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me just the places that have changed
	from the working copy to the new not working copy

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to compare to old things you done, to see how you progress and return to previus work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   pro - better control, you decide when it is a good commit so its better
   con - you can forget to commit sometimes, happend to me many times, but you can get used to it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    less files means cleaner to diff and so on, but i prefer multipe to keep it logic.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show me all of my history and diffrenet files.
	git diff will compare 2 different files, so I can see exactly what i changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easly revert the problems, or find what I fucked up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
